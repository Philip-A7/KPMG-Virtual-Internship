# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
Contains notebooks used for a data analytics consulting task as part of the KPMG Virtual Internship.

The "KPMG Forage Virtual Internship" notebook contains initial cleaning of the dataset, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and customer segmentation for existing customers.

The "Customer Prediction KPMG" notebbok builds on the results of the previous notebook, using the identified segments to choose which new customers (with no prior transaction data) should be targeted as high value customers.
